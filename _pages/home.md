As of July 2020, the IPOP (IP-over-P2P) project has moved to a new home.

Because the system has undergone significant architectural changes (layer-2 virtualization, SDN integration) and an increasing focus on edge computing, IPOP has been rebranded as [EdgeVPN.io](https://edgevpn.io)

_As of July 2020, this site is deprecated._ You can find the latest software and documentation in [EdgeVPN.io](https://edgevpn.io)
